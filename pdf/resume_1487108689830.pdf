Umpqua Bank  –  Hillsboro, OR   October 2015 – March 2016   
 
UI Engineer (contracted through TEKsystems) 
 As a UI Engineer I was responsible for the feature development and maintenance of Umpqua's online 
banking application. I worked in an Ember.js front end, with the full stack consisting of a complicated three-
tier web architecture. Alongside application development, I regularly assisted in upgrading the project to a 
more modern version of the Ember.js framework. I also consistently refactored legacy Javascript code to be 
dramatically more performant and clean, following the 'campfire rule' of leaving everything better than you 
found it. 
 
 Outside of development of the application, I became an integral member of our Development Scrum 
team. I was frequently involved in the interview process and hiring of fellow team members, as well as taking 
ownership and running weekly Scrum meetings. I constantly worked in tandem with the department Product 
Owner, Scrum Master, and BSA not only to deliver quality product, but also to help define the direction of the 
application and solidify business logic into the code.

 Beginning to define my career as a Web Developer, I grew my basic knowledge of simple concepts 
such as HTML, CSS, and various Javascript frameworks into higher-functioning implementation of HTML5 
elements mindful of Google AdSense, mobile-first responsive Sass designs, and Javascript code that integrates 
utility libraries while being mindful of efficiency.
